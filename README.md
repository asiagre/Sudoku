# SUDOKU

This is a console game - sudoku, written in Java. It is build with Gradle.
It is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. The objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits so that each 
column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 subgrids that compose the grid contain all of the digits from 1 to 9. 
The player can fill the grid completely or partially by putting the numbers in appropriate format (column,row,number) or 
type "SUDOKU" and the board will fill by itself.
